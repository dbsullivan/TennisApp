Execution.

Much of the project components are in place and are working. The code is packaged
well and coded neatly. The PlayerSearchServlet has a pretty crazy 'else if' block.
There might be a better way to guide your search.

The code is commented well and documented well in most places. This made it easier
to follow and read. Some of the code exceeded the max length (mostly queries). The
code is bracketed well and pretty consistent in terms of spacing.

Variable and method names are very good, descriptive, not abbreviated, and not
redundant. Getters and setters used (encapsulation). Logging is used at the info
level. I did not see any error handling but maybe it is hiding. There would be an
opportunity to log at the error level there.

J-Units started.

A well organized project. It is evident you have spent lots of time on this.

********************************************************************************

Your classes are well organized which makes it easy to follow the line of your
program. I also see you've added a bunch to the front end with jsps. Again you
could avoid the massive validation switch statements by using an enum or a map
of valid values.

Your code is commented well in some places but is missing javadoc in others. I
do see comments throughout to clarify your logic which will be helpful when
debugging and documenting later.

You have been continued to be consistent with naming, encapsulation, etc. I see
you added a bunch of unit tests. Your code seems to be more modular and you seem
to be getting the hang of it. Also you have added some error handling.

So lots more progress. Will check again next week.
